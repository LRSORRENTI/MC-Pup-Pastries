=======================
PUP PASTRIES TO-DO LIST
=======================

1. Wait for now on buying domain name, Mc is thinking
about which is best 

2. Change hover effect on bottom footer links, 
   Mc wants the hover effect to be a larger font size 
   by a few px

3. Keep carousel for now, Mc wants to take nicer pictures
and maybe have the carousel in a different spot?

4. Remove ingredient modal popup component

5. Ingredient list is not final for Chloe's cupcakes, added 
egg for bear's biscuits, also maybe need to space out 
the margin, the final list item of egg is close to 
the details about pastry span

5. Hide everything below the main card div on first load, 
when user presses details about pastry display, it shows the 
paragraph 'these dog-themed....' like a drop down menu 
effect

6. Make ingredient list inside of card component show and display
like a drop down menu, so initially the ingrediant list is 
hidden then when the user presses details about pastry it shows
the list

7. Try to use https://icon-icons.com/icon/print-paw/195246 as an 
image instead of list-style: circle or just the regular 
list style icons for ingredient list

==================
DOMAIN NAME CHANGE
==================

In order to not have the default heroku.123123123.app url: 

Heroku provides default domain names (like yourapp.herokuapp.com), 
but if you want to use a custom domain like pup-pastries.com,
you would need to purchase it through a domain registrar and then 
configure it to work with your Heroku app. 
Here's a general outline of the process:

Purchasing a Domain
Choose a Domain Registrar: Select a domain registrar 
(like GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.) 
to purchase your domain from.

Search for Availability: Search for your 
desired domain name (pup-pastries.com) 
to check its availability.

Purchase the Domain: Follow the registrar's 
process to purchase the domain.

Configuring the Domain with Heroku
Add Your Domain to Heroku:

In your Heroku dashboard, go to the "Settings" tab of your app.
Under the "Domains and certificates" section, click "Add domain".
Enter your domain name and save the changes.

DNS Configuration:

Heroku will provide you with a DNS target 
(like example.herokuapp.com or a set of DNS records).

Go to your domain registrar's website and access the DNS management section.
Update your DNS settings by adding the records provided by Heroku. This typically involves creating a CNAME record for www subdomains or using ANAME/ALIAS records for root domains.

Propagation Time:

DNS changes can take some time to propagate, 
typically up to 48 hours.

SSL (Optional but Recommended):

For secure connections (HTTPS), consider 
setting up SSL for your custom domain.

Heroku offers Automated Certificate Management (ACM) which provides free SSL certificates.

Verify Setup:

Once DNS changes have propagated, 
your custom domain should point to your Heroku app.

You can check this by visiting your custom domain in a browser.

Notes
Domain Renewal: Remember that domain names are 
typically purchased for a set period (like one year) 
and need to be renewed.

Heroku Documentation: Heroku has detailed documentation 
and guides for setting up custom domains which can be very helpful.
